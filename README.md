# Auto-Clicker

Auto Clicker so I don't get kicked while afking in minecraft. I also made couple other modes, some not minecraft related. Other modes in including mining, and spamming for discord aniversary. THis uses an arduino leonardo that can act like a keyboard/mouse. I used a oled display and some buttons to choose and activate modes.
